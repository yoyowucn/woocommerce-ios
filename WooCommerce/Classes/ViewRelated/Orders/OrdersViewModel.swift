    /// 2. Fetch the /orders?status=any
    ///
    /// We will also delete all the orders before saving the new fetched ones.
    ///
    /// We are currently doing this to avoid showing stale orders to users (https://git.io/JvMME).
    /// An example scenario is:
    ///
    /// 1. Load the Processing tab.
    /// 2. In the web, change one of the _processing_ orders to a different status (e.g. completed).
    /// 3. Pull to refresh on the Processing tab.
    ///
    /// If we were only doing one query, we would be fetching `GET /orders?status=processed` only.
    /// But that doesn't include the old order which was changed to a different status and is no
    /// longer in the response list. Hence, that updated order will stay on the tab and is stale.
    ///
    ///
    /// ## Why a Dual Fetch
    ///
    /// We could just delete all the orders and perform a single fetch of
    /// `GET /orders?status=processed`. But this could result into the user viewing an incomplete
    /// All Orders tab until we queried again. It's a jarring experience. Consider this scenario:
    ///
    /// 1. Navigate to Processing and All Orders tab to load their content.
    /// 2. Pull to refresh on the Processing tab.
    /// 3. Navigate back to the All Orders tab.
    ///
    /// On Step 3, since we deleted all the orders and only downloaded new processing orders, the
    /// All Orders tab will initially contain just those orders.
    ///
    /// The dual fetch is a "hack" to hide the sceanrio.
    ///
    ///
    /// ## Deleting all the Orders
    ///
    /// This sync strategy doesn't fix all our problems. I'm sure there are other scenarios that
    /// can cause stale data. In fact, synchronization by `pageNumber` almost always has bugs
    /// because orders could be on a different (previous) page when you load the next page. That
    /// order would then end up not getting loaded at all.
    ///
    /// Deleting all the orders during a pull to refresh is a "confidence button" for our users.
    /// When they use this, we are guaranteeing them that they will be viewing an up to date list.
    ///
    ///
    /// ## Spec
    ///
    /// This is how sync behaves on different scenarios.
